##Pre-Build and Planning


####Backstory:
I spent a questionably healthy amount of time in my childhood tearing apart and re-building bicycles that I uncannily kept winning from the local supermarket raffle. This project is a throwback to that deep love of building and invention. I wanted to create a fun way to replicate that experience online, with an educational bent. I also wanted to use the chance to explore additional front end technologies that we did not cover in the course, and play around with possibilities.

##Final Product

The final project is a drag and drop tool to build a bike piece by piece. The current version is not as educationally focussed as I first envisioned, and I would love to add that as a component if given more time in the future. My wish to explore new animation tools came true, and while many of the features I discovered while building the app are not implemented in the final version, I really valued that time to learn more about what is possible. If given all the time in the world, I would love to explore some three.js to start delving into basic 3d animations.
